# Zen Mode

What is Zen mode?

Zen mode is a simple layout that allows you to concentrate on reading and writing.
It is a minimalist design that removes all distractions from the page.
This mode is more suitable for people who prefer a simple and clean interface
rather than the default masonry layout.

Here is a demo of the Zen mode: https://g1en-site-zen-mode-preview.netlify.app/.

And below is a screenshot of the Zen mode:

<div style={{ width: '75%', marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>![Zen Mode](/images/zen-mode.png)</div>

To enable Zen mode, just add `zenMode = true` to the configuration file.

```
