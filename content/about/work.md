Iâ€™m a backend software engineer who loves building products that feel intuitive, reliable, and deliver meaningful value to the user. I'm currently working on the Marketplace experience at Roblox. Most of my work happens behind the scenes, building and shaping the data and API layers to deliver the cleanest, fastest shopping experience for our users. I love the challenge of turning messy or complex data into clean, reliable systems that make the product feel intuitive.
