title: Serial Hobbyist
---

I’m a serial hobbyist. I stumbled across the term a couple years ago and it's stayed with me since. I love hopping from one hobby to the next and always have a handful of projects that I should really get back to instead of starting a new one. Somewhere along the way, I figured I should start documenting the things I’m up to.
