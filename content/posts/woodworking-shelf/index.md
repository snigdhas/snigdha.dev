And it only took me 3 months.

One of the reasons I became interested in woodworking, besides the super cool and satisfying videos from [Blacktail Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iUSAaHrSX4) and [Foureyes Furniture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S4AdzNqz7I), was the ability to see a need for custom furniture and be able to build it. As we moved into our new home a couple years ago, we kept stumbling across relatively simple pieces of furniture that would easily cost upwards of $100 if we wanted it in wood, and even that might be particle board and a veneer. The craziest was when we realized that simple end table we'd bought for $25 in 2019 was now selling for somewhere between $100-$125. Wouldn't it be neat to be able to make it exactly the material, shape, ans size we wanted? Plus, how cool would it be to be able to say "I built that"?

So my first woodworking project was the planter I built for our kitchen balcony; a great starter project, but not really one that requires extreme precision.

I figured the next step was to build something like a floating shelf. Eventually, I'd love to build a handful of shelves to hold plants that aren't super cat-safe, so a single shelf to add storage for our guest bathroom was a great way to start.

I followed [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wki3wMAbtLg&t=190s) to build a shelf with no visible hinge or supports. Instead, we'll essentially make a 1" deep shelf that serves as the back-plate to fasten to the wall. The remaining 6" of the shelf's depth will be attached to the backplate using 1/2" dowels, making it easy to remove the shelf in the future. Before finding this video, I had spent some time looking into different shelf mounting options and had all but accepted that I'd have to use a metal mounting bracket that would be visible from some angles. The simple genius of this design and the clean finish made it a much more preferable option. The fact that it required multiple cuts and a securely fit dowel would also give me the chance to practice some finer skills.

I started building the shelf in August so I can't remember the specifics, but I think it took me 2 or 3 days of working on it to get the shelf done. The hardest challenges came more from my equipment than the project itself. I spent at least 20 minutes trying to rescue a drill bit that had gotten stuck while making the dowel holes, and keeping the cut for the backplate straight was a challenge as my saw's blade kept coming loose. The most frustrating, though, was sanding the 1/2" dowels down to fit in a 1/2" hole snugly but not too tight so we'd be able to remove it if needed.

The next step was to finish the wood, ideally with some walnut stain, and then we'd be ready to put the shelf up. Now I didn't take any pictures of the wood before I finished it so you'll have to take my word for it when I say that the pine I bought was looking a lot more red than I expected. As I started to read up on what grit to prep the surface to and how to pick between gel, water, and oil stains, I realized that pine is in fact well known for being blotchy to stain and having a very stark contrast in the grain. Consequently, the examples I could find of pine stained in walnut or similarly dark colors looked extremely rustic, which wouldn't fit our design aesthetic at all.

The alternative, then, was to paint the shelf white to match our bathroom cupboards and call it a day. But if you've read my project posts so far, you know me. One does not simply hit a roadblock and continue onwards. Or, I do not. I needed my 3-5 business days to do my research then come to terms with the results and and another 3-5 days to recover from the process. So the project sat there, collecting dirt in our garage for weeks until my husband suggesting I simply paint it with the extra wall paint we have. "Worst case, you can sand it off".

That's exactly what I did, after the necessary recovery period, and it turned out great! I still need to acquire some sort of sealant so it's safe from the the bathroom humidity, but technically, I made a shelf!

Now what should I make next?
