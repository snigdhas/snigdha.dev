Exploring the meaning behind our traditions.

<!--more-->

I've been thinking a lot about why I celebrate Diwali and what makes a Diwali celebration feel "right" for me.

I don't mean "Diwali is the festival of lights" or that we're celebrate the victory of good over evil, light over darkness, etc. We grew up hearing the stories. Diwali was one of a couple Indian holidays my family would celebrate with great excitement. Preparations would start a week in advance with a deep clean of the house and would end with an assortments of sparklers and special foods.

The way we celebrated changed as we got older and busier and eventually ended up in different parts of the country. So, to make sure Diwali didn't come and go without the appropriate fanfare, I started hosting parties of my own. Get a few friends together, some diyas and garlands for decor, and some good food and it's bound to be a good time. Last year, I even hosted a "Diwal'o'ween" party since Diwali and Halloween were on the same night, with a red-carpet theme and foods like 'Sinister Sev Puri' or 'Boo-rata'.

This year though, I just couldn't get into the Diwali spirit. While in previous years I had Diwali decorations up the week before Diwali, this year I was scrambling to clean and decorate on the day of. I went through the motions partly out of guilt and partly to hold onto the bits of tradition that reminded me of my childhood. Looking to social media was no break either. I'm not sure if Diwali has gotten more "trendy" or that the all-seeing algorithm knows me terrifyingly well, but the amount of Diwali content I saw leading up to the festivities was mind-boggling. Rangoli ideas, Diwali party foods, 5 different reels I could create with friends—don't ask me how many videos I saved as potential ideas.  If last year's party had taught me anything, though, it was that I couldn't keep trying to do something different or outdo myself year over year.

Despite the mixed feelings, I still held a simple Diwali party this year a week after Diwali in hopes that a commitment would bring the excitement. While it was really nice to hang out with my friends, that Diwali spark was entirely missing.

Then, why do I celebrate Diwali? Why put in the effort for Diwali parties? What was missing this year?

It's been about a couple weeks since this year's Diwali party and I'm still stuck on these questions. Normally, I'd say that for me, at its core, Diwali is about the people. It's about the family and close friends that bring light to my life. It's about the warmth from the diyas and string lights, the heat from the sparklers and the excitement as they fizzle and pop, and the oh-so-satisfying food that brings us together at the table.

I wish I could say that I found the joys of Diwali when I was least expecting it, or tie this up like a picture-perfect Hallmark movie, but thats just not true. Sure, I lit sparklers with my neighbors, filled the house with candles, and enjoyed good food with people I care for, but something felt like it was missing through it all. I know I always find celebrating Diwali without my family to be a bit rough, especially when my closest friends have theirs around. Maybe I was just extra homesick this year, or maybe the focus on the Diwali party and the event planning aspects of it overshadowed what makes Diwali truly special.

I celebrate Diwali because I believe in what it represents. When we clean our homes to welcome Lakshmi Ji, we hope to be blessed with wealth. My mom used to make us put diyas in each room, so no room of the house would be in darkness. By lighting these candles, we hope to banish darkness, and though I may not be a super religious person, that resonates with me.

I believe in the victory of good over evil and that one has been especially difficult to have faith in with current events this year. It's tough to look around and find the light this year, when so much is happening in our country and in the world that feels beyond my control. But when it comes down to it, I believe in doing a little something special to take a moment to be thankful for the joy and light that do exist around me and the richness and fullness that I can take for granted in my life. And I've got a lot to be thankful for, even if I'm lacking some of that Diwali spirit.
