#### 08/16: Officially starting the Felix pullover.
I agonized about what yarn to pick for a week or so, going back and forth between purchasing pricey yarn and opting for a cheaper wool blend. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to try knitting with 100% merino wool and stumbled upon the Knit Picks Swish line. Huge fan of the purple marled yarn color! The brown yarn is perfect for my next project, the [Silene top](http://snigdha.dev/posts/silene-top/).

I'm a bit wary about knitting a sweater in worsted weight, but the pattern calls for the chunkier yarn and it does have a certain charm in the project photos. I'm worries that the bigger knits will look clunky or highlight inconsistencies in my tension, but the positive is that this should knit up quickly. I'm not sure how I'll feel wearing a handmade sweater so it'll be nice to have a quick feedback loop here. 

I learned a fair amount about why blocking is important, but thankfully this yarn is a superwash. I'm hoping that makes it easier to wash and keep the right size.

#### 08/20: Wow this knits up fast.
The other knitters weren't kidding. It took me a while to get going and I had to rip the yoke back entirely as I messed up the leaflet placement. It's my first time learning to do shortrows and the pattern did a pretty decent job explaining it, but I did have to watch a couple videos before it made sense. I still think the pattern is beginner friendly, though having a visual guide to reference helps a ton.

#### 08/29: The body is mostly complete! 
It's time for the sewn tubular bindoff, which I always find somewhat difficult to fall into a rhythm for and even harder to retrace my steps if I lose my spot. 

09/01: The magic loops is magic, but annoying.
I started the first sleeve today and boy, the magic loop is a lifesaver since I don't have double pointed needles at the moment but it's also quite frustrating. I find that it slows me down a fair amount but there's not really a better way to be doing this. I did find a reddit post about knitting two sleeves at the same time, but the process of picking up the stitches and decreasing them for a fitted sleeve is challenging enough for now.

#### 09/24: It's done (kinda) 
I did it. I finished the sweater and the second sleeve. Second sleeve syndrome is so real - I found myself dragging my feet on completing the second sleeve. The only motivation I had to be done was that I needed these needles for the [Silene top](http://snigdha.dev/posts/silene-top/), which I wanted to start on my flight in a couple days.

#### 10/27: Sweater hiatus
A few weeks ago, I realized that the sleeves I knit were all the way up to the base of my thumb. Don't get me wrong, I like a long cozy sleeve to tuck my palms into! However, since I never did a blocked swatch, I have no clue how this sweater grows or shrinks in the wash. I'm okay with a wider body, but I've decided to leave the sleeves on the cord so I can rip it back if needed. I'm currently hyping myself up to go try washing the sweater to see what happens to the sleeves. Will it shrink back in the dryer or will we be repping a slenderman inspired fall couture?
