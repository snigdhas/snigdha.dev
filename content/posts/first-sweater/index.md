Things I've learned knitting the felix pullover and the mistakes I've made along the way

<!--more-->

I absolutely _adore_ the excitement that comes with selecting a new project and casting on those first stitches. Granted, I usually end up having to start over a couple times in the first 10 rows or so, but even knowing that, the charm of a fresh beginning isn't lost on me. At the same time, I find it extremely stressful to commit to the pattern or to a specific yarn and don't even get me started on gauge swatches.

#### Gosh Yarn-it, there's too many choices

Over the past two years, I've knit a handful of things I've really liked ranging from a [full-sized blanket](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/Snigdhas/billowy-quilted-throw-blanket) to an [adorable tank top](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/Snigdhas/olive-top), so I made it my goal for this year to knit a sweater come fall. That brought my to my first dilemma - there are hundreds of sweaters out there that proclaim to be "beginner friendly", but I'm easily bored. A sweater that's all knits the whole way down wouldn't hold my interest for very long.

I resorted to Ravelry and then eventually YouTube to hear from others on their experiences, which brought me to the [Wool Needles Hands](https://www.youtube.com/@WOOLNEEDLESHANDS) channel. Tayler's videos on the Felix sweater convinced me that was the way to start. The aran weight yarn should knit up quickly and was a cute and comfy design with a cheeky leaflet motif on the shoulders.

That brought be to my next decision - what yarn do I buy? I was a bit wary about knitting a sweater in worsted weight, but the pattern calls for the chunkier yarn and it does have a certain charm in the project photos. After visiting Michael's and local yarn stores, I was surprised to learn that my options were either acrylic/non-wool fibers or paying upwards of $100 for quality merino wool. As someone who can easily bore of a project, a rather sizeable upfront investment isn't usually the best course. That's where Reddit's knitting community pulled through. I wanted to try knitting with 100% merino wool and stumbled upon the Knit Picks Swish line which was both affordable and well liked.

HUGE fan of the purple marled yarn color! The brown yarn is perfect for my next project, the [Silene top](http://snigdha.dev/posts/silene-top/).

#### 3-2-1 Cast-on!!
Knitting gauge swatches and figuring out how to make sizing adjustments has always been a source of confusion for me and this time was no different. Through my yarn research, I learned a fair amount about the importance of blocking and the differences in superwashed yarn. Somehow, all this information mostly fled my brain when I was knitting the swatch and I didn't do a wet block to see the post-wash sizing.

True to the reviews, the sweater knit up incredibly quickly. Though the yoke and German shortrows took me 2 (or 3?) attempted to get right. I had to rip the yoke back entirely as I messed up the leaflet placement. It's my first time learning to do shortrows and the pattern did a pretty decent job explaining it, but I did have to watch a couple videos before it made sense. I still think the pattern is beginner friendly, though having a visual guide to reference helps a ton.

The rest of the body was an easy knit while watching TV or catching up with friends for the next two weeks.

#### Second-sleeve syndrome is so real
A more experienced knitter would have found my utter confusion on picking up and knitting the sleeves quite amusing. Once again, YouTube knitters saved the day and boy, the magic loop is a lifesaver since I don't have double pointed needles at the moment but it's also quite frustrating. I found that it slowed me down a fair amount but there's not really a better way to be doing this. This became even more frustrating on the second sleeve, when I was just powering through to the finish line.

Something I'd like to try for my next sweater is knitting the two sleeves at the same time. I stumbled across this [diagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/193j4fm/comment/kh9y0tj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which broke my brain while trying to understand how to knit sleeves but I've since seen other folks talk about their success with the strategy and it would certainly help with second-sleeve syndrome.

What did work for me, however, was the timeline I set for myself. I had to be done with the sleeves by a certain time because I needed the needles for the [Silene top](http://snigdha.dev/posts/silene-top/), which I wanted to start on my flight in a couple days.

Unfortunately, it's now been a month since I got back and I've yet to cast off the stitches and complete the sweater. Why? If you guessed blocking/sizing, you're an astute reader. At some point after completing the sleeves, I realized that the sleeves I knit were all the way up to the base of my thumb. Don't get me wrong, I like a long cozy sleeve to tuck my palms into! However, since I never did a blocked swatch, I have no clue how this sweater grows or shrinks in the wash. I'm okay with a wider body, but I've decided to leave the sleeves on the cord so I can rip it back if needed. I'm currently hyping myself up to go try washing the sweater to see what happens to the sleeves. Will it shrink back in the dryer or will we be repping a Slenderman inspired fall couture?

We may never know...
