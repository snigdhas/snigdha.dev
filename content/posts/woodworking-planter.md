My first woodworking project!

<!--more-->

I'm motivated by spite. Tell me you don't think I can do something and I will. I made it my mission to be able to run in heels in high school because people said it was hard. I binge-watched the entirety of Star Wars because my husband (then boyfriend) said I didn't seem like the type of nerd who had seen Star Wars.

So when my husband said I would just make plans and not actually build a planter, I had to get it done. And I had to do it without his help.

#### The lore

I've been going around telling my friends "I really want to try woodworking" for probably over a year. I even borrowed a circular saw from a friend and then it just sat there until he needed it back.

But recently, I had a week of no adult supervision (read: my husband was traveling for work) and a stroke of inspiration. I'd tried and failed to have an indoor collection of herbs a few times. So many times, in fact, that my husband has a running counter of basil plants I had killed. With the latest failure, we realized part of the issue was simply the smaller pot and unpredictability of indoor conditions. My mint plants, on the other hand, always ended up with aphids or other pests at which point they were tossed before it spread to the rest of our houseplants.

#### The project

Honestly, for someone who hadn't done woodworking before, the build was surprisingly easy. I followed [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/Elevated-Garden-Planter/) by MadeByMitch and had the folks at the hardware store cut the chunky 4x4x8 wood for the legs down to the right size since my saw wouldn't be able to cut through it all at once.

The hardest parts were:

1. A girl has short arms. Okay, that's not _necessarily_ true but you try holding a 4ft plank while screwing it to another 2ft plank. There's only so much the clamps were able to help and my workbench was not the right help to provide additional support. I had to fashion some makeshift surfaces stacking boxes on chairs to get everything to stay in place while I built the frame.
2. The wood was _insanely_ warped. Even though I tried to pick the nicest pieces out from the hardware store, there was a noticeable amount of warp that I hadn't taken into account when laying out the pieces for the frame. Unfortunately, this meant the prettier pieces would have to be put in the back because the warping was extremely apparent at the joints.

That said, I was able to cut the pieces one night and assemble them the next!

#### Finishing touches

Now, I'm not crazy. I had no intention of lugging this thing up from the garage to the balcony on my own so I did end up enlisting some help from my husband in the final steps of moving, sealing, and filling the planter.

The planter started out with some mint, basil, and thai basil and we've added on spring onions and a chilli pepper plant as well as some cilantro we sprouted from seeds. I'd say it's mostly been thriving, except for when the automated sprinkler didn't run for a couple weeks or when we ended up with what looked like leaf miners in the plants. But hey, they're all still alive and we now have fresh herbs for dinner and cocktails!
