9/27:
I first saw this top in one of [HipKnitHooray's](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/hipknithooray/silene-top) YouTube videos and immediately had to add it to my upcoming projects. The richness of the color and uniformity of the knits and purls as they form squares of 7 has such an elegance to it.

I cast on the project on a flight to the Galapagos and knit up around half of the body on the way there. At that point, I realized I had no recent measurments of myself and no way to determine if I needed to add waist shaping. 

As is often the case for my projects, this tiny hiccup seems to have derailed it entirely. I started the knit a month ago and haven't picked it up for the past 3 weeks. And no, I didn't need waist shaping at all so had I continued to knit the pattern as is, I'd probably be done. 

I'm not quite looking forward to the I-cords for the edges and straps - my first tank top I knit had i-cord straps that I found quite stressful to work. Since it's a smaller project and easier to travel with, I'm hoping I'll be able to work on it during Thanksgiving flights to visit family.
