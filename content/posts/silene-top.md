You ever see a pattern so perfect you can't stop thinking about it?

I first saw this top in one of [HipKnitHooray's](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/hipknithooray/silene-top) YouTube videos and immediately had to add it to my upcoming projects. The richness of the color and uniformity of the knits and purls as they form squares of 7 has such an elegance to it. I've struggled with finding work-appropriate tops for the summer (I love a good crop top) and I could absolutely knit this to be long enough to tuck in, so a double win!

I cast on the project on a flight to the Galapagos and knit up half of the body length on the way there. At that point, the pattern calls for optional waist shaping to keep the garment fitted to your torso, which is when I realized I had no recent measurements of myself on hand.

#### An inevitable hiatus

As is often the case for my projects, this tiny hiccup seems to have derailed it entirely. I started the knit a month ago and haven't picked it up for the past 3 weeks. And no, I didn't need waist shaping at all so had I continued to knit the pattern as is, I'd probably be done by now.

In my defense, I did try picking it up again during a particularly interesting conversation with a friend and absentmindedly knit multiple rows of purls, completely missing the pattern. So those mistakes have been undone, but the motivation to complete a top I won't wear until next summer is extremely low.

I'm not quite looking forward to the i-cords for the edges and straps either. My first tank top I knit had i-cord straps that I found quite stressful to work. Since it's a smaller project and easier to travel with, I'm hoping I'll be able to work on it during Thanksgiving flights to visit family.
