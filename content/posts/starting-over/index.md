Ah, the joys of imposter syndrome.

<!--more-->

So I started a new job at Roblox in August and while I’m really excited about the opportunity, the past couple months have been a reminder of how difficult it is to start over again and again. 

I have friends that have been at the same company with the same team for 7 or 8 years. Meanwhile, I seem to have developed a limited-time loyalty policy for each company I work for. Somewhere around year 3, I find myself getting a bit bored and starting to look around. 

On the whole, I’d say it has served me well. Leaving Google was a much needed change to go and learn how software is built at much smaller companies (60k -> ~150 engineers).  Working at Sentry was crucial for me to learn and internalize software best practices and build up a knack for building in a way that prioritized production health. Working on the company’s oldest and most-used product meant I was frequently battling tech debt and legacy code while trying to refactor and improve the product, with no shortage of feedback from the OSS community to build off of. 

I left Sentry a much more confident and capable engineer and leader. 

And good thing I did, because some of that confidence has been chipped away over the past 2 months at my new role. Sure, I still have the inherent knowledge and expertise and my design docs are probably much more solid, but it takes me 2-3x as long to get anything done. The codebase here is also way, way larger than Sentry's and has a microservice architecture where Sentry was more of a monorepo. Even the open source or publicly available tools we use have been adapted for our use cases or put behind and internally maintained proxy layer. 

_"So you're working a bit slower? You still know what you need to do, so just go do it. So what if it's a different tool?"_

Well, that's where imposter syndrome comes in. In my head, I'm not just moving slowly and ramping up as I learn each new tool. No, I'm falling behind and people are noticing how little I know about how secrets are configured and read at runtime for a service. It takes an exceptionally strong internal monologue to power through the feeling of doom that comes with that, and sometimes I forget my internal monologue at home.

_"Surely people haven't noticed anything wrong? You're new after all, they understand"_. 

See, the other problem with imposter syndrome is that it makes it really difficult to take any positive feedback seriously. When my manager said ‘wow you finished that task quicker than expected’, it barely made up for the stress I felt when he asked how that same task was going a couple days prior. Where the question prompted me to feel inadequate, the compliment barely brought my confidence back to earlier levels. Besides, maybe he just said that as positive reinforcement for getting it done.

Now add to that an unhealthy amount of self-confidence and you get someone who knows they’re capable of so much more that they’re falling short of their own standards. My manager was right to ask about that task - I could've finished it quicker!

Our brains are also a little too good at glossing over the challenges we overcame in the past. I'm sure I was just as confused when I joined Sentry. After all, every bit of tooling I used at Google was built in-house. Though I can't remember the mistakes I made or much of the learning process during my first few months, I guarantee I felt all these feelings and more. 
 
That's what makes this journey seem less overwhelming this time.

 I've started over before and I'll start over again.
