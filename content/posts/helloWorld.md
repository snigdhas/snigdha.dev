My first lines of code and my first blog post. Seems appropriate.

<!--more-->

I used to find the Hello World programming meme exceptionally cringe, and a little pretentious. _You're writing one line of code and announcing it to the world? Why should the world even care?_

As of late, though, I've found myself becoming more fond of the predictability behind it. Regardless of the language or framework, I know I can expect the docs to hold my hand through at least the first "Hello World". It's like knowing there's someone watching out for you in the scary world of poorly-documented tooling. 

But, I digress. Hello World. If you're here and reading my blog, hello to you too! 

Professionally, I’m a backend software engineer who loves building products that feel intuitive, reliable, and deliver meaningful value to the user. I'm currently working on the Marketplace experience at Roblox. Most of my work happens behind the scenes, building and shaping the data and API layers to deliver the cleanest, fastest shopping experience for our users. I love the challenge of turning messy or complex data into clean, reliable systems that make the product feel intuitive.

Outside of work, though, I’m a serial hobbyist. I stumbled across the term a couple years ago and it's stayed with me since. I love hopping from one hobby to the next and always have a handful of projects that I should really get back to instead of starting a new one. Somewhere along the way, I figured I should start documenting the things I’m up to. 

I expect this blog to lean more in the non-professional, keeping me accountable on my many in-flight projects and flitting from monologues on one topic to another in the amazingly chaotic way my brain works.
