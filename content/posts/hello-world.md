My first lines of code and now, my first blog post. Seems appropriate.

I used to find the Hello World programming meme exceptionally cringe, and a little pretentious. _You're writing one line of code and announcing it to the world? Why should the world even care?_

As of late, though, I've found myself becoming more fond of the predictability behind it. Regardless of the language or framework, I know I can expect the docs to hold my hand through at least the first "Hello World", a reliable guide in the scary world of poorly-documented tooling.

But, I digress. Hello, world! If you're here and reading my blog, hello to you too!

I'm Snigdha, a backend software engineer currently working on the Marketplace experience at Roblox. Outside of work, Iâ€™m a serial hobbyist. I love hopping from one hobby to the next and always have a handful of projects that I should really get back to instead of starting a new one.

So naturally, you can imagine that I've never been good at committing to journaling or documenting my life in any consistent way, but recently I've found myself wanting an online space to do so. I expect this blog to lean more in the non-professional, keeping me accountable on my many in-flight projects and flitting from monologues on one topic to another in the amazingly chaotic way my brain works.
